## 课文语法讲解

### Key structure

直接引语 变 简介引语

直接引语：直接用引号引用别人的原话。

简介引语：把引号去掉，转述别人的话。等同于宾语从句。

例句：

- 他说：“我是笨蛋。”（直接引语）

  他说他是笨蛋。（简介引语）

  He says, 'I am a fool.'（直接引语）

  He says (that) he is a fool. （简介引语）



- 跟时态相关时

  > He said, 'I am a fool.' 

  主句的said是过去说的，因此对应的从句都要变成过去。

  > He said (that) he was a fool.

- He said, 'I will go to Italy.'   一般将来时

  He said (that) **he would go** to Italy.   过去将来时，他说他要去意大利。

- He said, 'I went to Italy.'  一般过去时

  He said, (that) **he had gone** to Italy. 过去完成时，他说他去过意大利。
  
  

- ...... 'Mr. H will see you.' 这里人称要变，秘书对着我说要见我

  The sercetary told me (that) Mr. H would see me.

- ...... 'You will receive a thousand pounds.'

  He told me (that) I would receive a thousand pounds.



### 课文讲解

The secretary told me that **Mr. Harmsworth would see me**.

I **felt** very nervous when I went into his office.

> felt v. feel的过去式和过去分词

He did not look up from his desk when I entered.

After I had sat down, he said **that business was very bad**.

He told me **that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries**.

> can / be able to + afford + sth. / to do sth.

Twenty people had already left.

I knew **that my turn had come**.

> 该句是宾语从句，但不是引语。

'Mr. Harmsworth, ' I said **in a weak voice**.

> in a weak voice 用...的声音

'Don' t interrupt, ' he said.

Then he smiled and told me **I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year**!

> 每年1000英镑的额外收入



## 知识拓展

练习：填入said或told, 并填入括号中动词正确的时态。

```
said 后面接事，不能接人。
told 后面可以接事或人。
```



> He (said / told) me that she (come) the next day.

the next day 明天，主句 told 是过去，需要使用过去将来时

He told me that she would come the next day.



> He (said / told) he (cannot) understand me.

he是第二句话的主语

He said he could not understand me.



> I  (said / told) you I (have) never played tennis before.

I told you I had never played tennis before.



> He (said / told) that he (work) all day yesterday.

这里可以根据语境，想强调什么，填入什么时态

强调持续进行，使用过去进行时 was working

不强调，则一般过去时 worked

强调说之前工作了一整天，使用过去完成时 had worked

He said that he **was working / worked / had worked** all day yesterday.



> Why () you () that you (be) busy?

Why **did** you **say** **were / had been** busy?
