# 过去进行时

形式

```
was / were doing
```

用法

表示过去正在进行或持续进行的事。

> She **was reading** a book at 11:00 last night.

否定 She was not reading a book ... 

疑问 Was she reading a book ... ?



过去进行时常搭配 when / while / as 使用。

> **While** two detectives **were keeping** guard at the door, two others **opened** the parcel.

while 和 as 通常搭配延续性动词，用于进行时态，表示动作持续进行。

when 没有限制。

> Two detectives were keeping guard at the door, **when** two others opened the parcel.

调过来表达时，two others opened the parcel 不能使用 while 或 as。因为动作是瞬间完成，不是持续性。

例句：

> **While/As/When** they **were sleeping**, a thief **sneaked** in.
>
> They were sleeping, **when** a thief **sneaked** in.

进行时+进行时

> He was reading a book, **While/As/When** his wife was cleaning the house.
