## 课文讲解

1. 'The play **may begin** at any moment,' I said.

   at any moment 随时

   may begin，may + 动词原形，表示推测现在。随时可能会开始。

   

2. 'It **may have begun** already,' Susan answered.

   may have begun 推测过去，可能已经开始了。



3. I hurried to the ticket office. '**May I have** two tickets please?' I asked.

   May I ... 表示请求允许，我可以做某事吗？

   

4. 'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.

   we've 是 have 的缩写 = we have

   

5. 'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.

   pity 是一个名词，想感叹名词，使用 what 。

   

6. Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office. 

   '**Can I** return these two tickets?' he asked.

   'Certainly,' the girl said.

   I **went back** to the ticket office **at once**.

   go back 回到 ...

   at once 立刻



7. '**Could I** have those two tickets please?' I asked.

   Could 在这里语气更委婉、客气

   

8. 'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'

   虽然 can / may 可以表示允许，但是 certainly / sure / why not 在口语中使用，心里感觉更痛快和直接。

   

9. 'I **might as well** have them,' I said sadly.

   might as well = may as well 也可以吧，不如试一下，退而求次的选择，勉为其难。

   as well 也；也倒不如

   sadly adv. 悲伤地，难过地
