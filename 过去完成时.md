# 过去完成时

- 形式

```
had + done
```

- 用法：过去的之前（全部完成 / 部分完成）

- 例句：

> When he got there, she was not there.
>
> She    (leave).
>
> She **had left**.



- 过去完成时 变否定疑问

  She **had left**.

  否定：She **had not left**.

  疑问：**Had** she **left**?

  特殊疑问句：what **had** she **done**?



- 过去完成时 与一般过去时的搭配使用

  When he **got** there, she **had left**.

| got        | had left   |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 一般过去时 | 过去完成时 |
| 过去       | 过去的之前 |
| 后         | 前         |

注意：这两个时态为什么会搭配使用？

因为他们同样可以表示过去的事，而且还能强调两个动作的先后性。



例句：

- He finished work. He went home. (after)

  After he **finished** work, he **went** home.

  After he **had finished** work, he **went** home.

  He **went** home, after he **had finished** work.



- He finished lunch. He asked for a glass of water. (when)
