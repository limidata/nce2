# Lesson 28 No parking

Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths. He has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners. When he returns home at night, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate. Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once. Jasper has put up 'No Parking' signs outside his gate, but these have not had any effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen. I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. Jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has been turned to stone yet!

   - rare people 少数人

   - believe in 信仰，比普通的相信要更虔诚。
   - 信仰古代神话的少数人之一。

   - 为什么要用 believes ?

     believe 的形式要看 who，who 等于定语从句的先行词 one of those rare people，表示少数人之一，主语是一个人，使用单三的形式。

     

2. He **has just bought** a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in, he **has had** trouble with cars and their owners.

   - has just bought 现在完成时，在 L4 和 L5 课中有讲解。

     现在完成时：have / has + done

     现在完成时表示现在的之前怎么样。有时候为了强调时间间隔不久，会加上 just 表示刚刚。

   - has had 在 L18 课有讲解。

     have has 和 has had 是 have 这个动词的现在完成时。表示现在的之前有。

   

3. When he returns home at night, he always finds <u>**that** someone has parked a car outside his gate</u>.

   when 引出时间状语从句，表示当...时候

4. Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once.

   - I have ever seen 我曾经见过的
     - have seen 现在完成时，表示从现在回头看之前见过的最丑的脸之一。
