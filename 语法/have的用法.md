2. 助动词无实义，可以直接变成否定疑问。

## have 的用法补充

have / has had，是have动词的现在完成时，表示现在的之前有，现在的之前吃喝玩乐做。

have/has是构成现在完成时的助动词，had是实义动词变过来的过去分词。

> We **have had** trouble with the plan.

> 计划之前就有麻烦



had had (have 的完成时态)，是have动词的过去完成时，表示过去的之前有，过去的之前吃喝玩乐做。

第一个had是构成完成时的助动词，第二个had是从实义动词变过来的。

> I **had had** lunch at a village pub.

> 之前在乡村酒店吃过午饭。



have表示有，也可以使用have got。
单独出现 have 表示实义动词。
搭配got时，have 是助动词。因为 got 是 get 的完成时，get 表示得到、有的意思，所以have是助动词。

> You have a lot of money. = You have got a lot of money.

> do not have                            have not got
>
> Do you have ... ?                    Have you got ... ?
