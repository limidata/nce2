# have 的用法

## 用法

1. 实义动词：有（own / possess）

   I have a book. 一般现在时，原形

   She has a car. 一般现在时，第三人称单数

   He had a surprise.  过去时



2. 实义动词：吃喝玩乐做

   have a meal

   have breakfast

   have some water

   have fun

   have a good time

   have a swim   have + a swim (n.)，表示去做某事



3. 助动词：帮助构成完成时态，have 无实义。

   I have received a letter. 现在完成时，表示现在的之前收到一封信。

   She has bought a gift. 现在完成时，第三人称单数

   He had left. 过去完成时



## 变否定疑问

1. 助动词（完成时态中）无实义，变否定加 not，变疑问去掉 not 直接提前。

   | 陈述                      | 否定                              | 疑问                            |
   | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | I have received a letter. | I **have not** received a letter. | Have I / you received a letter? |
   | She has bought a gift.    | She **has not** bought a gift.    | Has she bought a gift?          |
   | He had left.              | He **had not** left.              | Had he left?                    |

   

2. 实义动词（有 / 吃喝玩乐做）不能直接变成否定疑问，需要搭配助动词，譬如 do / does / did 。

   | 陈述                | 否定                                                         | 疑问                     |
   | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
   | I have a book.      | I **do not have** a book.                                    | Do I / you have a book?  |
   | She has lunch.      | She **does not have** lunch.  （第三人称单数）               | Does she have lunch?     |
   | He had a good time. | He **did not have** a good time.   （did 表示过去，have 使用原形） | Did he have a good time? |



## 练习

判断用法，并变否定疑问

| 陈述                                 | 否定                                     | 疑问                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| You have a lot of money.             | You do not have a lot of money.          | Do you have a lot of money?          |
| They had a swim yesterday.           | They did not have a swim yesterday.      | Did they have a swim yesterday?      |
| She has eaten breakfast.             | She has not eaten breakfast.             | Has she eaten breakfast?             |
| My dog had taken it into the garden. | My dog had not taken it into the garden. | Had my dog taken it into the garden? |



## 用法补充

1. have 表示有，也可以使用 have got 。

   You have a lot of money. = You have got a lot of money.

   - 单独出现 have 表示实义动词。

   - 搭配 got 时，have 是助动词。因为 got 是 get 的完成时，get 表示得到、有的意思，所以 have 是助动词。

   | have              | have got           |
   | ----------------- | ------------------ |
   | do not have       | have not got       |
   | Do you have ... ? | Have you got ... ? |

   

2. have / has had，是 have 动词的现在完成时，表示现在的之前有，现在的之前吃喝玩乐做。

   have / has 是构成现在完成时的助动词，had 是实义动词变过来的过去分词。

   例句：

   - We **have had** trouble with the plan.

     计划之前就有麻烦。

   - It has had no effect.

     之前没效果。

     

3. had had (have 的完成时态)，是 have 动词的过去完成时，表示过去的之前有，过去的之前吃喝玩乐做。

   第一个 had 是构成完成时的助动词，第二个 had 是从实义动词变过来的。

   例句：

   - I **had had** lunch at a village pub.

     之前在乡村酒店吃过午饭。
