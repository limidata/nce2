# doing 动名词

1. 作主语

**Fishing** is my favourite sport.

动词作主语表示的是一件事，所以后面谓语动词用单数，`is`。

**Playing basketball with my friends every Sunday** is my favourite sport.



2. 介词后，作宾语

I often fish for hours without  `______`   (catch) anything.

I often fish for hours without **catching** anything.

without prep. 没有；无；不用；不带
