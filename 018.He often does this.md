### Key structure

参考：have的用法.md



### 课文讲解

1. After I **had had** lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag.

   - had had，have 动词的过去完成时，表示过去的之前吃过午饭。

     第一个 had 助动词，帮助构成过去完成时。

     第二个 had 表示吃，用在完成时态中，使用过去分词 had 。

   - 该句中有两种时态，have 的过去完成时 和 looked 的一般过去时。

     这两种时态搭配时，过去完成时先发生，一般过去时后发生。

   

2. I **had left** it on a chair **beside** the door and now it wasn' t there!

   - had left 是过去完成时，完成时态中的前一半是助动词。
   - 该句使用过去完成时 + 一般过去时表述。

   - beside prep. 在...旁边

     beside the door 在门旁边

   - besides prep. 除...之外

     **Besides** this book, I have some others.

     

3. As I was **looking for** it, the landlord came in.

   - looking for 带着目的到处看，寻找的意思。

   - 描述过去的两件事，一件事持续进行，另外一件事突然出现把它打断。

     持续进行的用过去进行时，铺陈故事背景。

     突然出现的用一般过去时。

   

4. “Did you **have** a good meal?” he asked.

   have 是实义动词，把助动词提前变疑问，表示吃了一顿好饭吗？



5. "Yes, thank you," I answered, "but I can' t pay the bill. I **haven't got** my bag."

   have got 意思表示有，但是有的意思来自于 get，而 have 只是构成完成时态。

   

6. The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned **with my bag** and gave it back to me.

   with prep 和...一起；带有

   with my bag 带着包
