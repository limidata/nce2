## 课文语法讲解

### 本课重点

1. 表示时间的介词短语
   - 参阅介词短语.md
2. 复习时态：一般过去时 / 过去完成时 / 过去将来时



### 课文讲解

1. **On Wednesday evening**, we went to the Town Hall.

   went 交代了时间背景都是讲过去的事。

   **on** Wednesday evening  如果出现了具体的天、星期，使用 on

   **in** the evening 没有出现天，上午、下午、晚上使用 in



2. It was the last day of the year and **a large crowd of people** **had gathered** under the Town Hall clock.

   a large crowd of ... 一大群

   had gathered  过去完成时：had + 过去分词，表示过去的之前就聚集在了钟楼下面。

   under 表示地点



3. It **would strike** twelve **in twenty minutes' time**.

   strike 敲打，敲击

   would strike 过去将来时：would + 动词原型。表示站在过去看之后，将来要发生的事。

   in twenty minutes' time 表示20分钟的时间，即20分钟之后。in 搭配将来时态（不管是一般将来时，还是过去将来时），表示在（时间段）之后。
   
   twenty minutes' time 名词所有格
   
   


4. Fifteen minutes passed and then, **at five to twelve**, the clock stopped.

   five to twelve 表示5朝着12的方向走。即差5分钟12点。

   at 表示在某个时间点

   pass 作为动词使用，表示经过，过去了。
   
   


5. The big **minute hand** did not move.

   hour hand 时针

   minute hand 分针

   second hand 秒针；二手
   
   
   
6. We waited and waited, but nothing happened.

   waited and waited 两个动词叠加，表示动作不断延续

   sth. happen to sb. 某事发生在某人身上

   

7. It's two minutes past twelve!

   past 也表示经过，但不作动词使用。It's 表示 It is，已经有动词了。一个句子只能一个谓语动词。



8. I looked **at** my watch.

   look vi. 不及物动词，所以需要 + 介词（prep.），来搭配宾语。

   介词只能接名词、代词（宾格）、动名词doing，构成介词短语，也称介宾结构。



9. It was true.

   true adj. 真实的

   truth n. 事实，真相

   false adj. 不真实的，错误的



10. The big clock **refused to** welcome the New Year.

    refused to do 拒绝做某事

    welcome the New Year 欢迎新年
